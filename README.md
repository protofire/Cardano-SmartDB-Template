# SmartDB Project Template

Welcome to the **SmartDB Project Template**! This repository provides a ready-to-use template for projects implementing the [SmartDB library](https://protofire-docs.gitbook.io/smartdb). It contains the essential files and directories needed to kick-start your application, offering a foundation to develop with SmartDB seamlessly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>.git
cd <your_repo_name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Resources

### CBOR Files

To start the project, you need the **CBOR files** of the Plutus smart contracts you plan to implement. These files are essential for deploying and interacting with on-chain scripts.  
- CBOR files can be generated using the appropriate Plutus tools or your preferred Haskell development environment.  


### Scaffold Project

You must install the **Scaffold Project** to define and generate your SmartDB entities.  
The Scaffold Project provides tools for:  
- Creating database schemas.  
- Generating TypeScript types for both MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

To get started with the Scaffold Project, follow the instructions in its [official repository](https://github.com/protofire/Cardano-SmartDB-Scaffold/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction).  

Once installed, you can use the scaffold commands to generate entities for your SmartDB project.
## Market Place Example

Explore a comprehensive [**step-by-step guide**](./docs/simpleMarketExample.md) for building an end-to-end project with SmartDB in the file.

This example demonstrates how to:
- Implement entities using SmartDB.
- Develop basic CRUD functionalities.
- Create frontend components for marketplace operations.
- Deploy and test your application.
